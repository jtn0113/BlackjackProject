# Blackjack Project

## Description
BlackjackApp is a card game that allows the player to play blackjack against the dealer. 
When you run the program, the dealer will generate a new deck of cards and shuffle them.
- The dealer will automatically deal the initial two cards to you and himself, leaving his first card face down.
- If you hit blackjack, the dealers card will be flipped and the winner will be determined immediately.
- Otherwise, you will be presented with an option to hit or stand. This option will continue after every hit, until you either stand or bust.
- If you bust, the game will be over immediately and you lose.
- If you stand, the dealer will then play the game.
- If the dealer busts, the game will be over immediately and you win.
- If the dealer stands, the scores will be checked and a winner will be determined and printed to the screen.
- After the winner is shown, you will be presented with an option to play again or quit. You may play again as many times as you wish.
- If you choose to play again and the current deck has less than 15 cards left, the dealer will create a brand new deck.

## Lessons Learned
For this lesson I learned how to use enums in Java, this was the first project in which I used them. I found them to be very useful and will try to implement them more in the future.
